# JavaScript Study Plan – Month 0 (Foundations)
This extended Month 0 (M0) plan of the “JavaScript (0 → Pro)” roadmap includes targeted
exercises for each topic. Each topic is designed to help you solidify your JavaScript foundations
through focused coding practice and small experiments.
How to Work with the Plan
- Weekly time commitment: 8–12 hours.
- 60–20–20 rule: 60% projects, 20% focused learning, 20% reading/documentation.
- Weekly structure: 3× learning sessions, 2× practice, 1× project block.
## Topics & Exercises (Weeks 1–4)
1. Data types and operators, truthy/falsy values, control flow (if/switch/loops).
    - Write a script that checks if a number is even, odd, positive, or negative.
    - Create a grading system using if/else and switch statements.
    - Iterate over an array of numbers and print only multiples of 3 or 5.
2. Functions, arrow functions, scope, hoisting, closures.
    - Write a function expression and an arrow function doing the same task.
    - Create a closure-based counter with increment/decrement methods.
    - Demonstrate hoisting with var, let, and const inside a function.
3. Objects, prototypes vs. classes; this, bind/call/apply.
    - Create an object with methods that use 'this' and test with bind/call/apply.
    - Implement a constructor function and rewrite it as a class.
    - Build a prototype chain with 2–3 objects and show inheritance of methods.
4. ES Modules, import/export syntax.
    - Split a program into multiple files using export/import.
    - Create a math module (sum, multiply, divide) and use it in another script.
    - Use a default export and multiple named exports in the same module.
5. Error handling with try/catch/throw, creating custom errors.
    - Write a function that throws an error if the input is not a number.
    - Wrap API simulation in try/catch and log a custom message on failure.
    - Create a custom error class 'ValidationError' and use it in form validation.
## Mini Projects
1. CLI Calculator (Node.js, no frameworks).
2. Password Generator (CLI with options).
## Final Projects
1. Rebuild one mini-project from scratch without notes.
2. Add documentation (README + usage examples).
3. Push to GitHub and write a short blog post on what you learned.
## Self■Check Questions
- Can I explain closures in my own words with an example?
- Do I know when to use pure functions and how to estimate O(n) complexity?
- Can I debug code effectively using DevTools?
